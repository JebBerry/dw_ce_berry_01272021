I used Apache Tomcat 7 for this project.

To use this project start the Tomcat server and you should be able to access the GET methods directly through the web browser.
I used postman to handle testing the POST functions.

The url for this service is shown below:

http://localhost:8080/StoreFront/StoreService/{parameters}

Where {parameters} represents the desired formated call.
